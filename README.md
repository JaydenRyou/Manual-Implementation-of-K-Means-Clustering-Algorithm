# Manual Implementation of K-Means Clustering Algorithm

## Introduction
Welcome to the final project IS327. This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience on how to manually implement the unsupervised learning algorithm K-means.

In this project, I will dive into the world of unsupervised learning and gain a comprehensive understanding of how K-means works. By implementing the algorithm manually, I will not only learn the technical details of K-means but also the machine learning pipeline, including data exploration, data preprocessing, and data visualization.

Through this project, I will explore the fundamental concepts of clustering and gain valuable insights into how clustering can be used to analyze data. With the knowledge gained from this project, I will be able to apply K-means to real-world problems, explore other clustering algorithms, and develop a deeper understanding of unsupervised learning.

## Brief Overview
The objective of this project is to implement the K-means clustering algorithm manually and compare it with the K-means implementation in the Sklearn library. The project will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for clustering.

After preprocessing, the K-means algorithm will be implemented from scratch, which involves initializing the centroids, assigning data points to clusters, and updating the centroids iteratively until convergence.

Next, I will compare the results of our implementation with the Sklearn K-means module by measuring the clustering accuracy using evaluation metrics such as inertia, and silhouette score.

Finally, I will visualize the clustering results using a Voronoi diagram to see how well our algorithm has divided the data points into clusters.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the K-means algorithm and its implementation from scratch, as well as its performance compared to the Sklearn implementation, and visualizing the results to provide an intuitive understanding of the algorithm's behavior.
