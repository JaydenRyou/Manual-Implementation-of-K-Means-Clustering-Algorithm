# Manual Implementation of K-Means Clustering Algorithm

## Introduction
Welcome to the final project IS327. This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience on how to manually implement the unsupervised learning algorithm K-means.

In this project, I will dive into the world of unsupervised learning and gain a comprehensive understanding of how K-means works. By implementing the algorithm manually, I will not only learn the technical details of K-means but also the machine learning pipeline, including data exploration, data preprocessing, and data visualization.

Through this project, I will explore the fundamental concepts of clustering and gain valuable insights into how clustering can be used to analyze data. With the knowledge gained from this project, I will be able to apply K-means to real-world problems, explore other clustering algorithms, and develop a deeper understanding of unsupervised learning.

## Brief Overview
The objective of this project is to implement the K-means clustering algorithm manually and compare it with the K-means implementation in the Sklearn library. The project will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for clustering.

After preprocessing, the K-means algorithm will be implemented from scratch, initializing the centroids, assigning data points to clusters, and updating the centroids iteratively until convergence.

Next, I will compare the clustering centroids results obtained using the sklearn implementation of KMeans with the results obtained using a manually implemented version of KMeans, where I use the same initial centroids for both implementations.

The comparison of the resulting centroids will involve computing the Euclidean distance between each pair of centroids obtained from both implementations. If the centroids obtained from both implementations are similar, we should expect the distance between them to be small.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the K-means algorithm and its implementation from scratch, as well as its performance compared to the Sklearn implementation.
